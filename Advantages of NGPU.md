## Advantages of NGPU

### Advantages for Individual Developers
Individual developers seeking GPU computing power focus on:

+ **Cost Sensitivity**: Individual developers are most concerned about investment costs, making them very sensitive to the price of GPU computing power.
+ **Ease of Development**: Individual developers want to quickly validate their product ideas, so platforms that allow rapid implementation of product features are highly favored.


For individual developers, using the NGPU platform to provide GPU computing power for their applications is appropriate for the following reasons:

**<span style="color:green;">Cost Sensitivity</span>**
1. NGPU uses decentralized computing power, enabling idle computing power to serve individual developers, resulting in very low acquisition costs.

**<span style="color:green;">Ease of Development</span>**
1. For individual developers without cluster development capabilities, the NGPU platform encapsulates complete GPU computing power monitoring and intelligent scheduling functions, eliminating the need for developers to create their own monitoring, scheduling, and queuing systems.
2. NGPU offers a plethora of API interfaces to meet individual developers' needs for task scheduling, progress queries, daily and hourly task summaries, AI task power consumption summaries, and detailed queries. This reduces the development time investment for individual developers.
3. NGPU provides dashboard-related plugins, allowing individual developers to intuitively monitor the detailed information and GPU consumption of each AI task.

+ Example 1:
```json
        For example, an individual developer named Xiao Hong deploys her business on an AWS server (assuming $3000/month) and promotes it for a month, with an assumed usage of 1. Xiao Hong would have spent $3000 to keep her program running, leading to resource waste and uneven distribution. If she spent this $3000 on promotion instead, it could be more beneficial for the product. Using NGPU, Xiao Hong does not need to spend $3000 to maintain her program. The platform ensures the program remains online, and charges are only incurred when there is usage. For instance, if the gas fee per call is $10, and there is one usage in a month, Xiao Hong's monthly cost would only be $10.

```
+ Example 2:
```
        A developer named Xiao Ming (pseudonym) tries to provide image transformation services in a specific style during the AI boom. This AI service, based on Stable Diffusion, requires 15G of video memory. On AWS, a T4 16GB g4ad.xlarge instance costs $0.379 per hour, or $272.88 per month without network services. In contrast, NGPU's 3090 24GB is priced at $0.000366 per second based on actual usage. If each image takes 10 seconds, the cost per image is $0.00366. Compared to AWS's monthly quote, NGPU is cost-effective if fewer than 74,557 images (272.88 / 0.00366) are generated monthly. For small developers with limited promotion capabilities, monthly orders are much lower than 74,557, averaging around 3,000. Using NGPU would only cost $10.98 per month, just 4% of AWS's cost. Additionally, Xiao Ming only needs to deploy the AI image transformation image on the NGPU platform, which can call the platform's cluster service capabilities, avoiding the risk of service downtime due to single server failure and simplifying development and operation. NGPU's elastic scaling ensures smooth service during peak order times without overload-induced downtime.

### Advantages for Small B2B Teams
Small B2B teams seeking GPU computing power focus on:

+ **Ease of Development**: Small B2B teams have limited budgets, so they prefer GPU computing platforms that offer as many features as possible (task summaries, task information, scheduling information, etc.), saving development costs and speeding up product launch time.
+ **Handling Task Peaks and Troughs**: Small B2B teams often have difficulty estimating the number of end users or AI task requests, leading to either excess or insufficient computing power server rentals, resulting in task peaks and troughs. Excess results in wasted rental costs, while insufficient capacity fails to respond to user requests in time.
+ **Stable Business Operation**: Small B2B teams strive to retain users, so they require stable GPU computing power to maintain business operations.

For small B2B development teams, using the NGPU platform to provide computing power for their applications is suitable for the following reasons:

**<span style="color:green;">Ease of Development</span>**
1. Similar to individual developers, NGPU offers numerous API interfaces and SDK packages, reducing the development workload for small B2B teams.
2. NGPU's intelligent scheduling eliminates the need for small B2B teams to develop their own GPU computing power scheduling systems.


**<span style="color:green;">Handling Task Peaks and Troughs</span>**
1. NGPU is an elastic computing power network. When the workspace's GPU computing power demand exceeds the threshold, it automatically scales up. The scaled-up GPU nodes can provide services for AI tasks, avoiding task backlog and business impact.
2. NGPU aggregates and bills based on the actual GPU consumption per AI task, maximizing resource usage fee savings with pay-as-you-go billing.

**<span style="color:green;">Stable Business Operation</span>**
1. NGPU monitors the load of AI applications in real time and uses intelligent scheduling. When a GPU node goes offline, another node capable of handling AI tasks is automatically invoked, ensuring stable business operation even if a GPU node fails.


+ Example 3:
```json
        In Example 1, if Xiao Hong unfortunately passed away but her program remained popular, users might not be able to use it if hosted on AWS. However, with NGPU, the program can continue to function, even in Xiao Hong's absence. This aligns with the trustworthiness and permanence ethos of Solidity.
